class Vagrant(base.Base):
    """
    The class responsible for managing `Vagrant`_ instances.  `Vagrant`_ is
    `not` the default driver used in Molecule.

    .. important::

        This driver is alpha quality software.  Do not perform any additonal
        tasks inside the `setup` playbook.  Molecule does not know about the
        Vagrant instances' configuration until the `converge` playbook is
        executed.

        The `setup` playbook boots instances, then the instance data is written
        to disk.  The instance data is then added to Molecule's Ansible
        inventory on the next execution of `molecule.command.create`, which
        happens to be the `converge` playbook.

        This is an area needing improvement.  Gluing togher Ansible playbook
        return data and molecule is clunky.  Moving the playbook execution
        from `sh` to python is less than ideal, since the playbook's return
        data needs handled by an internal callback plugin.

        Operating this far inside Ansible's internals doesn't feel right.  Nor
        does orchestrating Ansible's CLI with Molecule.  Ansible is throwing
        pieces over the wall, which Molecule is picking up and reconstructing.
